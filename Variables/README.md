<h3> What is variable why do we even care?</h3>

<p>Variable is a named of data that is assigned value. When we need to use we just need to call the variable name. We can modify the value by using the variable name. Some are mutable and some are immutable, that's means sometimes we can change the value which are called mutable others are not changeable called immutable.</p>

    $variable2 = "PHP";

    for($i = 0; $i < $variable1; $i++){
        echo $variable2"\n";
    }
